# Quarterly Review Data Map

Use this table to align memory categories with the sections of the quarterly review.

| Section | Memory Category | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| Goals vs Outcomes | `okr-updates` | Summaries of OKRs, roadmaps, or quarterly goals. | Ensure each entry has owner, target, actual, and confidence. |
| Key Metrics | `metrics-digest` | KPI snapshots for revenue, product usage, support, or reliability. | Include data source (dashboards, analytics exports). |
| Product and Launch Highlights | `launch-notes` | Release summaries, rollout notes, or feature adoption commentary. | Capture links to changelogs or artifacts. |
| Customer Impact | `customer-story` | Wins, testimonials, churn saves, or advocacy opportunities. | Tag accounts consistently (e.g., `account:atlas-labs`). |
| Risks and Mitigations | `risk-log` | Risks, blockers, and mitigation plans. | Document owner, due date, and status. |
| Appendices | Custom tags | Supporting assets: dashboards, decks, raw exports. | Store links or file paths rather than large attachments. |

Update the category list whenever the team introduces new tagging conventions.
