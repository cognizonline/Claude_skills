# Idea Tagging Guide

Use consistent tags to keep the vault searchable and organized.

| Tag Type | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `topic:` | `topic:wordpress-automation`, `topic:memory-analytics` | Group ideas by theme or product area. |
| `audience:` | `audience:marketing`, `audience:developers` | Identify who benefits from the idea. |
| `timeline:` | `timeline:now`, `timeline:quarter`, `timeline:future` | Indicate when to act on the idea. |
| `status:` | `status:backlog`, `status:in-progress`, `status:launched` | Track idea lifecycle. |
| `inspiration:` | `inspiration:customer-feedback`, `inspiration:research` | Capture sources for future reference. |

Apply at least one tag from each category when logging a new idea.
