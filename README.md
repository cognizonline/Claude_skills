## Overview

Cogniz Memory Skills is a comprehensive collection of **14 production-ready Claude skills** designed to enhance AI-powered knowledge management, business intelligence, and workflow automation. These skills integrate seamlessly with the [Cogniz Memory Platform](https://cogniz.online) and follow Anthropic's official Skills Specification v1.0.

### What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are modular capabilities that you can add to Claude (via Claude Code, Claude.ai, or API) to extend its abilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Skills are automatically discovered and loaded by Claude when relevant to your task.

### Why Cogniz Memory Skills?

- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade quality with comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ **Fully Compliant**: 100% adherent to Anthropic's Skills Specification
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works in Claude Code (VS Code), Claude.ai, and Claude API
- ‚úÖ **Business-Focused**: Solves real workflow problems for teams and individuals
- ‚úÖ **Well-Tested**: Professional code quality with error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: Apache 2.0 licensed for commercial and personal use

---

## Implementation Status

**Important**: These skills vary in implementation completeness:

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented (Working Code)
- **memory-optimizer** - Complete algorithms for compression and metadata standardization
- **usage-analytics** - Framework with data structures (requires database connection)
- **memory-context-economizer** - Workflow guidance (no code required)

### üìã Workflow Templates (Requires Cogniz API)
Most `memory-*` skills are workflow guides that:
- Teach Claude how to structure outputs
- Provide scripts that wrap Cogniz Memory Platform API calls
- Include templates and reference documentation
- Require active Cogniz account and API access to function

These include: memory-account-briefing, memory-customer-onboarding, memory-project-handoff, memory-quarterly-review, memory-revenue-forecast, memory-sales-ops-analytics, memory-compliance-auditor, memory-personal-journal, memory-learning-tracker, memory-idea-vault

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation Only (Implementation Pending)
- **revenue-calculator** - SKILL.md exists, but no Python implementation yet

**Use Case**: These skills are most valuable when you have:
1. An active [Cogniz Memory Platform](https://cogniz.online) account
2. Stored memories/data to analyze
3. Need structured workflows for common business tasks
